#Stevenson Screen Parts

![Stevenson Screen](/Images/Stevenson Screen.jpg)

The Stevenson screen is remixed from Galto2000's design on Thingiverse http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:83969

My only modification to the design is for the base to increase the diameter of the pipe mount to fit my 1 1/4 inch pipe and added a hole for a PG7 cord grip.

The BME280 is so small I figured that two middle disks and a top and bottom probably provides enough air space.
