#Solar panel parts

The solar cells that I used are these from ebay:

They are 90mm X 60mm rated for 6v output at 600mw. The panel frame should be deep enough to use a PG7 connector for power connections and have enough space for the wiring. This is a modified design from what I am using, if you look in the picture you can see that I added a spacer to mine to give clearance for the connector. I am just planning on mating the two parts with silicone and I hot glued the cells into the frame from the back. The design could use screws and improved weather proofing.
